If you are looking for a book that will help you improve your productivity, efficiency, and agility in any project, you should check out Scrum: The Art Of Doing Twice The Work In Half The Time by Jeff Sutherland and J.J. Sutherland. This book is a comprehensive guide to Scrum, a revolutionary management system that has been used by some of the world's top technology companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Spotify.
 
Scrum is based on the idea that people are spectacularly bad at doing things with agility and efficiency, and that the best way to overcome this is to work in small, self-organizing teams that deliver value in short iterations called sprints. Scrum also emphasizes deep accountability, team interaction, and constant iterative improvement, which can lead to amazing results in any domain where leaders wrestle with complex projects.
