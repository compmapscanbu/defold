## Why Use Photo Mechanic?
 
Photo Mechanic is not a photo editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom. It does not have any tools for adjusting exposure, contrast, color, or other aspects of your images. However, it does have some features that make it a great companion for your photo editing workflow. Here are some of the reasons why you should use Photo Mechanic:

- It is extremely fast. Photo Mechanic can load and display your images almost instantly, without any lag or delay. This is because it uses the embedded JPEG previews from your camera's RAW files, instead of generating its own previews. This means you can browse through hundreds or thousands of images quickly and easily, without wasting time waiting for them to render.
- It is easy to use. Photo Mechanic has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you access all its functions with a few clicks or keyboard shortcuts. You can customize the layout, the colors, the fonts, and the metadata fields to suit your preferences and needs. You can also create presets and templates for common tasks and apply them with a single click.
- It is compatible with most cameras and formats. Photo Mechanic can read and write metadata to almost any type of image file, including JPEG, TIFF, PSD, PNG, RAW, DNG, and more. It also supports video files and can extract still frames from them. It can handle files from most camera brands and models, including Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, and more.
- It is versatile and powerful. Photo Mechanic can do more than just browsing and tagging your images. It can also help you with tasks such as renaming, resizing, cropping, watermarking, exporting, uploading, printing, and more. It can also integrate with other software such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Capture One, or any other program that supports drag-and-drop or command-line launching.
