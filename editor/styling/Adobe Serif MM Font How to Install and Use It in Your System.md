# What is Adobe Serif MM Font and How to Use It?
  
Adobe Serif MM font is a type of [multiple master font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_master_font) that was developed by Adobe Systems. Multiple master fonts are fonts that can have multiple variations along one or more axes, such as weight, width, or optical size. Adobe Serif MM font can be used to create custom fonts that suit different design needs and preferences.
  
However, Adobe Serif MM font is not a font that you can download or install on your computer. It is an internal substitution font that is used by Acrobat and Reader to display text for fonts that were not embedded within a PDF file[^1^]. Embedding fonts is a recommended practice that ensures the correct display and printing of PDF documents. If a font is not embedded, Acrobat and Reader will try to find a similar font on your system or use a default font such as Adobe Serif MM or Adobe Sans MM.

You can also use Acrobat's [Edit PDF](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/edit-text-pdfs.html) tool to change the font of the text to a different one.
